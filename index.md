## About Me

My name is Branden Sioson and I am one of the many computer science majors at UCSD. I'm more of an introverted person but I won't shy away from doing anything fun. Currently, when I'm not so busy with schoolwork and internship searching, I enjoy my hobbies which include pc building and cosplaying. I've learned to code in many languages but mostly only simple things and nothing really to complex. As such, I always feel like there's more to learn about coding and as such always welcome any advice that may come my way.

### Languages I've Used Before:

I've used a few but these are the ones I feel I have a decent backgroud in:

* *Python*
* *Java*
* *Markdown*
* *C*
* *C++*
* *R*
