## About Me

My name is Branden Sioson and I am one of the many computer science majors at UCSD. I'm more of an introverted person but I won't shy away from doing anything fun. Currently, when I'm not so busy with schoolwork and internship searching, I enjoy my hobbies which include pc building, gaming, and cosplaying. I've learned to code in many languages but mostly only simple things and nothing really to complex. As such, I always feel like there's more to learn about coding and as such always welcome any advice that may come my way. I still won't ever forget the first line of code I typed which was ```print("Hello, World!")``` in Python.

### Languages I've Used Before:

I've used a few but these are the ones I feel I have a decent backgroud in:

* *Python*
* *Java*
* *Markdown*
* *C*
* *C++*
* *R*

### Top 3 Languages:

Based off how familiar and effective I am with them:

1. *Java*
2. *Python*
3. *Markdown*
   

## My Life With Computers

At the age of 5, my very first computer was one of those really old IBM personal computers that used to run Windows98. Technically it was my family's computer but it was my first time interacting with one. The first game I ever played on a pc was Minesweeper and although I was extremely bad at it, I found myself stuck playing the game. Over time, my interest of computers grew and eventually I'd dream of being "one of the people behind the computers". This got me further interested in the field and by middle school I was claiming that my dream career would be a Software Engineer funnily enough. I had a goal and wanted to learn as much as I could. I also grew in interest in building pc's by then, but had no means to actually try it out. Eventually in high school when the pandemic started, I would build my very first pc. I was happy with it and used it from then to now, upgrading it along the way using [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/). My pc went from [this](#first-pc) to [this](#current-pc).

I've also altered my terminal to look a lot different from default. [How it looks](screenshots/Step%203%20Part%202.png)
